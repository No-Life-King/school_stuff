# school_stuff
A repository of my school work.

Hi, you've reached Phil's github. I don't have a facebook or a twitter but I do have a github and a plotly. I've been writing code for a long time and right now I'm in school to further my knowledge of computer science and to get another degree or two to prove that I know what I'm doing. 

This repository is pretty much just going to be used to host my school work and maybe a few other things that I happen to be working on, so if I didn't link you here directly then there's probably not too much here that may be of interest to you. But of course, it's public domain so you're welcome to take a look around.
