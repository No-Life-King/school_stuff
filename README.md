# school_stuff

Hi, you've reached Phil's github. I don't have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook" title="Click here if you want to know what facebook is!">facebook</a> or a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter" title="Click here if you want to know what twitter is!">twitter</a>, but I do have a <a href="https://github.com/No-Life-King/">github</a> and a <a href="https://plot.ly/~No-Life_King">plotly</a>. I've been writing code for a long time, and right now I'm in school to further my knowledge of computer science and to get another degree or two. 

This repository is pretty much just going to be used to host my school work and maybe a few other things that I happen to be working on, so if I didn't link you here directly then there's probably not too much here that may be of interest to you. But of course, it's public domain, so you're welcome to take a look around.
