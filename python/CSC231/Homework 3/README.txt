There are a few programs that I'm staunchly opposed to using - Microsoft Excel is one of them. I chose to generate my graphs using plotly instead. The html files in this folder contain interactive versions of the graphs. In case they don't work on your machine, I also included image files of the static graphs. I hope you find this technique acceptable as an alternative to graphing in Excel.
